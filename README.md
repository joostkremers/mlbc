This code is based on the book [Machine Learning Bookcamp](https://www.manning.com/books/machine-learning-bookcamp). The code from the book is in the `org` subdirectory in the form of [Org](https://orgmode.org/) files. The `.py` files are based on this code, with my changes and additions.

## Chapter 2 ##

- Put the code from the book into a number of utility functions in `general/utils.py`.
- Modify `prepare_X()` to run additional functions to engineer new features.
- Add the functions `binary_encode()` and `encode_age()` for use in `prepare_X()`.
