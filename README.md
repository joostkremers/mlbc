# MLBc #

This code is based on the book [Machine Learning Bookcamp](https://www.manning.com/books/machine-learning-bookcamp). The first few commits contain code from the book in the form of an [Org](https://orgmode.org/) file `notebook.org`. Further commits record my changes and additions:

- Put the code from the book into a number of functions in `utils.py`.
- Modify `prepare_X()` to run additional functions to engineer new features.
- Add the functions `binary_encode()` and `encode_age()` for use in `prepare_X()`.
